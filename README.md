Translation of "RETRIEVE.PAS" (Pascal programming language) to Python3 ("retrieve.py")

There are 2 old programs (UCTOLD and UCTPHO) that run as “UCTOLD.exe” and “UCTPHO.exe” files which were generated (~1990) by
compiling TurboPascal 4.0 files.

These programs both generate output files with an 8 character alphanumeric string of user choice and a “did” extension  e.g.  “CTWWTP05.did”.

This .did output file is then converted to a print (.prn)  file with another TurboPascal 4.0 programme called “RETRIEVE.exe”, which reads the e.g.
“CTWWTP05.did” file and converts it to a “CTWWTP05.prn” file, that can be imported into spreadsheets to work with the output results.

The UCTOLD is for simulating biological N removal plants and UCTPHO is for simulating biological N and P removal plants.

The only “RETRIEVE.exe” file I have (dated 1991/08/15 1:13pm) works only for “
.did” files generated by UCTOLD, not for “ .did” files generated by UCTPHO.

I suspect there was a second RETRIEVE.exe file that worked for UCTPHO but it seems I have lost it.

I suspect the reason RETRIEVE.exe only works for UCTOLD is that the number of
concentration versus time variables generated by UCTPHO is greater than the
number generated by UCTOLD.

As a result last year (2017) I could give the Postgraduate (PG) class only
simulation exercises with UCTOLD, not UCTPHO because the UCTPHO output could
not be imported into Excel.

I would like the “RETRIEVE.exe” code to work for both UCTOLD and UCTPHO so that
next year (2019) I can give the PG class simulation exercises with both UCTOLD
and UCTPHO.

I have four Retrieve.pas files and I attach the youngest RETRIEVE.pas (dated
1991/06/03 9:56am) file that presumably generated the RETRIEVE.exe  file.

Do you think the RETRIEVE.pas code can be translated to some new software like
Python so that I can use the RETRIEVE code for both UCTOLD and UCTPHO?

The specification of the Turbo Pascal 48 bit "Real" type was found on: http://www.shikadi.net/moddingwiki/Turbo_Pascal_Real 

While most languages use a 32-bit or 64-bit floating point decimal variable,
usually called single or double, Turbo Pascal featured an uncommon 48-bit float
called a real which served the same function as a float. 32 and 64-bit floats
were introduced in Turbo Pascal version 5. Pascal's successor, Delphi, did not
feature reals as a variable type.

A Pascal real has a value range of 2.9 x 10-39 to 1.7 x 1038.

The structure of a Pascal real is seen in the diagram below.

```
Byte  0        1        2        3        4        5
Bit   01234567 01234567 01234567 01234567 01234567 01234567
Value EEEEEEEE MMMMMMMM MMMMMMMM MMMMMMMM MMMMMMMM SMMMMMMM
```

E: exponent, M: mantissa, S: sign bit
